## About The Program

I found these poems and thought it would be cool to download the file, and was dissapointed that it was just a plain ascii file without any kind of formatting. So instead of spending an hour formating it manually, I decided to spend **10's of hours** writing a program to parse it and display it as a formated web page.

My goal was to not change the initial ascii file in any way. Stupid goal.
