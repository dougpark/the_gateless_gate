## History

The common theme of the koans of the Wumen Guan and of Wumen's comments is the inquiry and introspection of dualistic conceptualization. Each koan epitomizes one or more of the polarities of consciousness that act like an obstacle or wall to the insight. The student is challenged to transcend the polarity that the koan represents and demonstrate or show that transcendence to the Zen teacher.

## About This Program

I found these koans and thought it would be nice to download the file, and was dissapointed that it was just a plain ascii file without any kind of formatting. So instead of spending an hour formating it manually, I decided to spend **10's of hours** writing a program to parse it and display it as a formated web page.

My goal was to not change the initial ascii file in any way. Stupid goal.

My first text parsing using Javascript, and my first use of Regular Expressions (Regex).
